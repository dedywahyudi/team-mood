### Note to reviewers

Currently the date of the application is set to match the storyboard (6 March).
This date is configurable as mentioned in the `README.md` file, for demonstration & testing purpose.

To make the app take the current date (not a fixed one), the value for
`TODAY` muste be set to `new Date` (eg: `export const TODAY = new Date;`), in `src/config`.

This is done solely for the purpose of ease of testing!
